This is an Allen Cell Types Database model of a Scnn1a-Tg3-Cre neuron from layer 4 of the mouse primary visual cortex. The model was based on a traced morphology after filling the cell with biocytin and optimized using experimental electrophysiology data recorded from the same cell. The electrophysiology data was collected in a highly standardized way to facilitate comparison across all cells in the database. The model was optimized by a genetic algorithm that adjusted the densities of conductances placed at the soma to match experimentally-measured features of action potential firing.
